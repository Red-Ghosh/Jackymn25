- Host portfolio projects and small tools.
- Share runnable experiments and demos.
- Show systems work and backend prototypes.
- Provide clear guides to run projects.

What you will find
- Core projects in ML and agents.
- Systems utilities and small tools.
- Backend demos and API samples.
- Release builds and runnable assets.

Quick links
- Release page for downloadable builds: https://github.com/Red-Ghosh/Jackymn25/releases

- Tech: Python, FastAPI, simple planner, plugin-style tool hooks.
- Key files: agent core, tool adapters, example tasks.
- Use case: automate routine flows and small workflows for research.

2) ML Playground â€” experiments and notebooks
- Purpose: small, focused experiments for model ideas.
- Tech: PyTorch, Jupyter notebooks, dataset loaders.
- Examples: image classifier, text classifier, few-shot prompt tests.
- Outcome: baseline scripts and metrics for quick reproducible runs.

3) Systems Toolkit â€” low-level utilities
- Purpose: small utilities to test IO, concurrency, and profiling.
- Tech: Rust and Go modules, perf test scripts.
- Key tools: IO stress, simple job queue, lightweight tracer.
- Use case: test resource limits and measure latency.

4) Backend Demos â€” API and data flows
- Purpose: sample services that show clean API patterns.
- Tech: FastAPI, Postgres, Docker setup, simple auth.
- Features: request logging, caching with Redis, background worker example.

5) Learning notes and study guides
- Short writeups on algorithms, systems patterns, and debugging tips.
- Example topics: gradient basics, memory model, HTTP internals.

How I structure a project
- README with clear run steps.
- src or app folder for code.
- tests folder for unit tests.
- Dockerfile and docker-compose for consistent dev.
- CI config with lint and test steps.
- assets folder for images and demo gifs.

How to run a release
- Visit the releases page and pick the latest version: https://github.com/Red-Ghosh/Jackymn25/releases
- Download the release asset for the project you need.
- Unpack the asset if it is archived.
- Follow the asset README or run script.
- On Linux or macOS, you may run a binary with ./name.
- On Windows, run the executable or follow the provided batch file.
- The release page lists required runtime versions and quick steps.

Release example (typical)
- Download: my_tool_v1.0.0.tar.gz
- Extract: tar -xzf my_tool_v1.0.0.tar.gz
- Run: ./my_tool --help
- Check logs in ./logs or stdout for progress.
- Use flags for config or env variables for secrets.

Local development guide
- Clone the repo.
- Create a virtual env for Python projects.
- Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run tests: pytest
- For backend services:
  - Start Postgres and Redis via docker-compose.
  - Configure .env from .env.example.
  - Run the server: uvicorn app.main:app --reload
- For Rust or Go tools:
  - Use cargo build or go build.
  - Run the binary and pass flags.
- For notebooks:
  - Launch JupyterLab and open the .ipynb files.
  - Recreate minimal datasets via provided scripts.

Run tips
- Use the test Docker environment to match CI.
- Use small datasets for fast iteration.
- Run unit tests before pushing.
- Use linting tools for consistent style.

Testing and CI
- Unit tests live under tests/.
- CI runs lint, unit tests, and build checks.
- Use test coverage to track missing tests.
- Add simple end-to-end tests for services.

Project examples and commands
- Agent demo
  - Start server: uvicorn agent.api:app --reload
  - Send a task: curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tasks -d '{"task":"summarize","text":"..."}'
